# Image Classifier

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project the `.ipynb` file contains image classifier built with PyTorch, the `train.py` and `predict.py` have the Python command line application.


## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository into your local computer
```
ยง git clone https://github.com/Aljasere/udacity-image-classifier-project
ยง cd ImageClassifier
```

## Usage
Training image classifier:
* Download labeled image data set.
* Image extension should be `.jpg`.
* Prepare the `.json` file.
* Default-hyperparameters are adjustable and included in the `train.py` file.
* Run `Python train.py` to start training.

Predicting the the most lilely probability:
* Run `Python predict.py` to test the classifier.
